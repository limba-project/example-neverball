# Limba Neverball Example

This is a more complex example on how to create a Limba[1] package.
It demonstrates how to:
 * Build a Limba package with the build-helper
 * Handle multiple dependencies
 * Create a Limba repository
 * Automatize the build process

More information and explanations of the single steps will follow.

The final Limba repository, containing Neverball with all its dependencies,
can be found here: http://people.freedesktop.org/~mak/stuff/neverball-lirepo/

Please keep in mind that this repository contains software from multiple organizations,
using different licenses. Please refer to the individual projects for more information about
licensing.

The Limba package definitions are public domain or subjected to the MIT license. Descriptions
might be copyrighted by the respective project which wrote them (refer to the individual files).
